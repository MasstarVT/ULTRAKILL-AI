# Times

Leaderboard of the AI's level completion times across training generations.
Times are in-game level time (`mm:ss.mmm`), not wall-clock training time.

## Leaderboard

Best time per level. A generation only takes a spot by beating the current record.

| Level | Time | Rank | Generation | Difficulty | Date | Notes |
|-------|------|------|------------|------------|------|-------|
| 0-1 | 07:20.714 | B | campaign_gates@5.57M | Violent | 2026-09-17 | training episode (sampled actions), fresh start |

## Generation history

Best run from each generation, newest first. Keep every generation here, even ones that didn't set a record.

| Generation | Level | Time | Rank | Kills | Deaths | Δ vs previous | Date | Notes |
|------------|-------|------|------|-------|--------|---------------|------|-------|
| campaign_gates@5.57M | 0-1 | 07:20.714 | B | 64 | 1 | — | 2026-09-17 | training episode (sampled actions), fresh start |

<!--
How to add an entry:
- Generation history: add a row at the top of the table for the new generation's best run.
- Leaderboard: if that run beats the level's record, replace the level's row (one row per level, sorted by level order).
- Rank is the in-game style rank (D, C, B, A, S, P). Δ vs previous is the time change from the previous generation on the same level, e.g. -1.250s.
